ASAI, the Argentine Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, is an annual event intended to be the main forum of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in Argentina. The symposium aims at providing a forum for researchers and AI community members to discuss and exchange ideas and experiences on diverse topics of AI. Previous ASAI editions stimulated presentations on both applications of AI and new tools and foundations currently under development. 

The XII Argentine Symposium on Artificial Intelligence (ASAI 2011) will be held during  29th – 30th August 2011, in Córdoba, Argentina, at the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional - Facultad Regional Córdoba.

ASAI 2011 will be part of the 40th JAIIO, the 40th Argentine Conference on Informatics, organized by SADIO. JAIIO is organized as a series of thematic symposia including topics such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, technology, agroinformatics, high performance computing, industrial informatics, free software, law, health, information society, and a students contest.

PAPER SUBMISSION
==================
ASAI 2011 seeks original contributions in a wide spectrum of Artificial Intelligence, ranging from state-of-the-art academic research to industrial and business applications having a significant impact. The symposium will consist of invited talks and regular paper sessions presenting mature work (full papers) in theoretical research and applications. A poster session will be devoted to the presentation of new ideas and less mature work in general (extended abstracts).

Submissions are due before May 2nd. Submissions can be made through the EasyChair system, the submission site will be made available soon. Delayed submissions will most likely be rejected. All papers received before the deadline will be peer-reviewed by referees of the area.

The submission of manuscripts must follow the format available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. The page limit for a full paper is 12 pages. Extended abstracts describing novel research visions, work-in-progress or less mature results are also welcome, with a limit of 4 pages. All contributions should be submitted in Ghostview-readable Postscript or PDF formats. For diffusion reasons, papers in English are strongly recommended (Spanish is also acceptable). 

Information on the format of the camera-ready copy will be forwarded with the acceptance letter.  Each accepted paper must be presented in the symposium, and the presenter must be registered in the conference.
